# User Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a user dashboard application built with React. The application fetches user data from an external API and displays it in a series of styled, interactive user cards. Each card includes basic user information, and when clicked, opens a modal displaying detailed user information, including the user's name, contact details, address, and company information.

## Features

- **Dynamic User Cards**: Displays user details such as name, username, and email in easy-to-read cards.
- **Search and Sort**: Allows users to search for specific names or usernames and sort by these fields.
- **Detailed Modal View**: Each card expands into a modal that provides full user details upon clicking.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with styled-components for a consistent and adaptable UI across screen sizes.

## My Work

I designed and implemented the frontend using React, focusing on creating an attractive, user-friendly, and responsive interface. I also styled the components for an interactive experience, including hover effects and a clickable overlay to close the modal when clicking outside it.
